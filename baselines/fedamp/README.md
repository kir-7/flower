# FedAMP: Personalized Cross-Silo Federated Learning on Non-IID Data.

**Abstract:** : Non-IID data present a tough challenge for federated learning. In this paper, we explore a novel idea of facilitating pairwise collaborations between clients with similar data. We propose FedAMP, a new method employing federated attentive message passing to facilitate similar clients to collaborate more. We establish the convergence of FedAMP for both convex and non-convex models, and propose a heuristic method to further improve the performance of FedAMP when clients adopt deep neural networks as personalized models. Our extensive experiments on benchmark data sets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed methods.


## About this baseline

**What’s implemented:** : The code in this directory implements the algorithm in *Personalized Cross-Silo Federated Learning on Non-IID Data* (Huang et al., 2021) for CIFAR-10 and Fashion MNIST datasets under pathological sampling. It evaluates the performance under fraction-train of 0.2 and 0.5 against FedAvg and FedProx. 

**Datasets:** CIFAR-10, Fashion MNIST

**Hardware Setup:** These experiments were run on a Tesla T4 GPU with 16 GB VRAM provided through Google colab session with GPU enabled. The total time for a single fedamp experiment with 20% pariticipation is ~20 minutes and 50% participation is ~60 minutes.

## Experimental Setup

**Task:** Image classification

**Model:** The default CNN models is used for all experiments for CIFAR-10 and Fashion MNIST (see `model.py`).

**Dataset:** This baseline includes CIFAR-10 and Fashion MNIST datasets. It will be partitioned into 40 clients following a pathological split where each client has examples of three (out of ten) class labels. The settings are as follows:

| Dataset | #classes | #rounds | #partitions |     partitioning method     |  partition settings  |
| :------ | :------: | :-----: | :---------: | :-------------------------: | :------------------: |
| CIFAR-10   |    10    |   60   |    40    | pathological | 3 classes per client |
| Fashion MNIST   |    10    |   60   |    40    | pathological | 3 classes per client |

**Training Hyperparameters:**
The following table shows the main hyperparameters for this baseline with their default value (i.e. the value used if you run `flwr run .` directly)

| Description         | Default Value                                      | Note |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |-------
| total clients       | 40                                                 | Since the algorithm is cross-silo algorithm.
| clients per round   | 8                                                   | This is set using fraction-train default=0.2
| number of rounds    | 60                                                | --
| client resources    | {'num_cpus': 2.0, 'num_gpus': 0.2}                | By default GPU is used, if CPU-only experiments, then set 'num-gpus'=0.0
| data partition      | pathological sampling (3 classes per client) | 
| optimizer           | SGD with proximal term                             |
| proximal mu         | 0.6                                                | Used for comparison experiment against FedProx
| fedamp_lambda | 1.0                                                | Used in combination with alphaK for the proximal weight
| sigma | 1.0                                                |  Used to calculate the cosine similarity (see `strategy.py` line `304`)
| alphaK | 1.0                                                | Used in combination with fedamp_lambda for the proximal weight

```
 
For Fashion MNIST experiments replace the dataset attribute to `fashion`.


## Expected results

After running the above commands, the results should be stored in respective folder (`fedavg_results` / `fedprox_results` / `fedamp_results`) in json format containing training history. These are plotted using utility functions provided in `utils.py`. The plots that would be generated are shown below.
